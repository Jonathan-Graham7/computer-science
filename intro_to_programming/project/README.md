    # Math Bowling Game
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description:
    A game in which the player(s) rolls three six-sided die, then uses the three die rolls in equations that equal 1 through 10 including
    possibilities for any of those numbers to be negative. The equation must use all three die rolls and can use any of the following operations:
    addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, root extraction, and factorials. Factorials and square roots only require
    a single digit since factorials are performed only on a single integer and square roots are a special case of root extraction with an implied 2
    as the index.
    The scope of this project is beyond just this assignment. This step is to simulate the game being played for a single frame with an argument 
    option to simulate the last frame, since the last frame in bowling is slightly different than the rest of the frames. The next piece of the 
    process will be to have the program able to simulate the full ten frames of a bowling game. Following this is to have the game ported to a web 
    application using this python code as the backend. The last thing will be to have a coutdown clock running on the web app so that the program 
    will be fully self regulating and not rely on any external factors in order to fully play properly.
